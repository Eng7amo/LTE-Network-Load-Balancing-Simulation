# LTE-Network-Load-Balancing-Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains a simulation of a network load balancing system that dynamically distributes traffic across multiple connections based on Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as latency, packet loss, and signal strength.

## Features
- Implements a priority-based session management system.
- Dynamically adjusts connection weights based on network conditions.
- Simulates real-world networking parameters such as latency and signal strength.
- Supports logging and debugging for performance evaluation.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the simulation:

```bash
jupyter notebook network_load_balancing.ipynb
```

## File Structure
- `network_load_balancing.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the simulation code and analysis.
- `README.md`: Documentation and usage instructions.

## Example Outputs
The simulation generates insights into:
- Connection health (latency, packet loss, signal strength).
- Load distribution based on dynamic conditions.
- Session allocation based on priority levels.
